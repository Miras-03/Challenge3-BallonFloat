# Challenge3-BallonFloat
Applied my knowledge of physics, scrolling backgrounds, and special effects to a balloon floating through town, picking up tokens while avoiding explosives.


Hints:

* The balloon floats up as the player presses spacebar
* The background moves at start, then stops when the game is over
* Made bombs or money objects spawn every few seconds
* Made the fireworks display at the balloonâ€™s position
* Made the background repeat seamlessly
* Bonus - Prevent the player from floating their balloon too high 
* Bonus - Made the balloon appear to bounce off of the ground, preventing it from leaving the bottom of the screen.
